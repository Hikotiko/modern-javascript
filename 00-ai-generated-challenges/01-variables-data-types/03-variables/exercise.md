## 3 Hands-On Exercises

### 1. Variable Declaration & Logging (Easy)

**Task:**  
Declare a `let` variable for your favorite programming language.  
Declare a `const` variable for the year you started learning programming.  
Print both to the console.

---

### 2. Reassignment Rules (Moderate)

**Task:**  
Declare a variable `let city = 'Paris'`.  
Reassign it to `'London'`, then print.  
Try the same with `const country = 'France'`.  
Attempt to reassign it to `'UK'` and observe what happens.  
Explain the result in a comment.

---

### 3. Scoping (Challenging)

**Task:**  
Write a small script that declares a variable with the same name in both global and block scope using `let` or `var`.  
Print the value inside and outside the block to show how scoping works.

## 3 Cumulative Real-World Examples

### 2. Website Launch Banner

**Task:**  
You have a `const` for the launch date and a `let` for “daysUntilLaunch.”

### 3. User Session State

**Task:**  
Declare a `let` for “isLoggedIn” (true/false) and a `const` for “maxLoginAttempts.”  
Write logic to decrement attempts and log out the user if attempts are exhausted, explaining why “maxLoginAttempts” should be a constant.
